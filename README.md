Application made for a game mod ( ComputerCraft ), it is an addon to other app I've made, it basically keeps track of a turtle (which function is mining) coordinates, fuel, and progress, so you can relax while your turtle does the job for you :).

## Materials Needed

 - Advanced Computer
 - 12 Monitors
 - Ender Modem

# Setting up the computer

## (1st step - Placing the computer and monitors )

Start by placing your computer and 12 monitors, the computer has to make contack with monitor in some way (right, left, top, botom...), here's one sugestion:

## (2nd step - Setting up the computer)

First, start by running:

 ``` wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K3vinb5/Display/main/install/install.lua ``` 

 to install the app.

The app will then run automatically the setup ( You can run it yourself in case you misspelled someting later by runnnig ``` setDisplay ``` )

You will be asked on what side is your modem on and on what side is the monitor on

## (3rd step - Setting up the turtle)

The computer should restart and if you didn't run the ``` setDisplay ``` before on your turtle you should do it now, in the monitor it will be displayed the id of the computer so you can insert it on your turtle.

After you run ``` setDisplay ``` on your turtle and the turtle starts working on a hole the computer will find the turtle and display its information, and once you have configured this, you will never have to do it again, every time the turtle starts the program, you will have its information displayed.
